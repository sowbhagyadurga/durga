# ETHExplorer â€“ Nodejs

## About

It&#39;s a NodeJS based, Server side ETHExplorer

For one of our clients I created a private Ethereum blockchain and had to create an Eth Explorer. I found many Eth explorers implemented in AngularJs and they were quite slow. Moreover, AngularJs version of Eth explorer requires Ethereum Node to be exposed to public access. I felt security threats and implemented the equivalent version in Nodejs(https://nodejs.org/en/) and used EJS (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) to template this Nodejs app. Its faster, lighter. Some of the features might be missing like refreshing blockchain info on regular intervals etc., Will add web sockets in future version and try to cover all the features. Thanks to Carsenk (https://github.com/carsenk) I used his Angular version as the reference code.
